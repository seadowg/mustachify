# mustachify

## Description

You know how you always wished you could easily change images on your site so the person in it had a moustache? Well now 
you can do that.

## Use

Basically just do this on any HTML element to 'mustachify' all the images in it (here we do it to the body):

    $('body').mustachify()
    
Done? Yup its that easy. You can also call `mustachify` directly on an `img` element if you wish.

## Thanks

This is only possible because of the awesomeness of [afeld's](https://github.com/afeld) site [mustachify.me](http://mustachify.me). Thanks for the laughs.
